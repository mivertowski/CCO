- **Features**: Have an idea? Open an issue first to discuss
- **Documentation**: Help improve our docs
- **Tests**: More test coverage is always welcome
- **Mission Templates**: Share useful mission configurations
- **Performance**: Optimize token usage or execution speed

### First Time Contributors

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are great starting points!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cco.git
cd cco

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_test_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_test_key  # Optional
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Provide types for all parameters and return values
- Use interfaces over type aliases where appropriate

### Code Style
```typescript
// Good
export interface MissionConfig {
  title: string;
  repository: string;
  definitionOfDone: DoDCriteria[];
}

// Bad
export type MissionConfig = {
  title: any,
  repository: any,
  definitionOfDone: any[]
}
```

### File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core orchestration logic
â”œâ”€â”€ llm/            # LLM integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ models/         # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/   # External integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ cli/            # CLI interface
```

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Interfaces: `IPrefixOptional`

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- orchestrator.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Writing Tests
```typescript
describe('Orchestrator', () => {
  it('should initialize with mission', async () => {
    const orchestrator = new Orchestrator(config);
    expect(orchestrator).toBeDefined();
    expect(orchestrator.mission).toEqual(mission);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >80% coverage for new code
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update from upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run checks**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Update documentation** if needed

4. **Write clear commit messages**:
   ```
   feat(orchestrator): add retry logic for failed tasks
   
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Add max retry configuration
